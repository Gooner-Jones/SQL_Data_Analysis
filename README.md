# About Me
Hi, I'm Neo — a Microsoft Certified Fabric Analytics Engineer with a growing passion for data engineering. I thrive on solving real-world problems using SQL, and I'm especially excited about the capabilities of Microsoft Fabric. From building data pipelines to exploring insights in the Lakehouse, I enjoy every part of working with data inside this evolving ecosystem.

This portfolio reflects my journey into the tech field, showcasing my hands-on projects, SQL skills, and curiosity-driven learning. Outside of work and code, I’m a proud single dad and a lifelong Arsenal supporter (yes, even through the tough seasons!).

Thanks for checking out my work — let’s build something great with data.
